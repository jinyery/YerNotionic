# YerNotionic

YerNotionic is a static blog that updates in real time, synchronizing changes to Notion pages without rebuilding the deployment.
It is forked from [Notionic](https://github.com/izuolan/notionic) and has been improved in details compared to the original version, with the following modifications:  
- Added automatic generation of slug
- Optimized generation of page titles
- Removed parts related to craft.io
- Improved adaptation to Utterances
- Fixed some fragmentary bugs on the UI
